# AI-machinelearning-week3
understanding and implementation of AI tools and framework
## Objective & Guidelines
This project evaluates the understanding of AI tools/frameworks and their real-world applications through a mix of theoretical and practical tasks. A demonstration of proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve problems.
The project has three parts: theory, which tests the theoretical understanding of AI Tools; Practical, which tests the implementation skills of AI tools; and Ethics and optimization, which tests ethical AI development and AI software optimization skills. 
### Submissions
1)Code: Well-commented scripts/Jupyter notebooks. 
2)Report: A PDF with:
Answers to theoretical questions. 
Screenshots of model outputs (e.g., accuracy graphs, NER results).
Ethical reflection.
3)Presentation: a 3-minute video explaining  approach used.
## Tools & Resources
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, spaCy.
Platforms: Google Colab (free GPU), Jupyter Notebook.
Datasets: Kaggle, TensorFlow Datasets.

### Why This Matters
Real-World Impact: These tools power industries from healthcare to finance.
Skill Validation: Employers seek proficiency in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

## Part 1: Theoretical Understanding 
1. Short Answer Questions
Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

2. Comparative Analysis
Compare Scikit-learn and TensorFlow in terms of:
Target applications (e.g., classical ML vs. deep learning).
Ease of use for beginners.
Community support.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation 
### Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn
Dataset: Iris Species Dataset
Goal:
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode labels).
Train a decision tree classifier to predict iris species.
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.
Deliverable: Python script/Jupyter notebook with comments explaining each step.

### Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
Goal:
Build a CNN model to classify handwritten digits.
Achieve >95% test accuracy.
Visualize the model’s predictions on 5 sample images.
Deliverable: Code with model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.

### Task 3: NLP with spaCy
Text Data: User reviews from Amazon Product Reviews.
Goal:
Perform named entity recognition (NER) to extract product names and brands.
Analyze sentiment (positive/negative) using a rule-based approach.
Deliverable: Code snippet and output showing extracted entities and sentiment.

## Part 3: Ethics & Optimization 
1. Ethical Considerations
Identify potential biases in your MNIST or Amazon Reviews model. How could tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCy’s rule-based systems mitigate these biases?

2. Troubleshooting Challenge
Buggy Code: A provided TensorFlow script has errors (e.g., dimension mismatches, incorrect loss functions). Debug and fix the code.

Deploy Your Model: Use Streamlit or Flask to create a web interface for your MNIST classifier.
